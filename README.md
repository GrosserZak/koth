## About the game
### KOTH
King.Of.The.Hill

King of the hill is a mini game most players will be familiar with, either through minecraft or by playing pretty much any other strategy game. 

The aim of king of the hill is to conquer the castle, fort or anything else in the middle of the arena, the arena is usually a large map of some sort with surrounding walls.
The top point usually on a hill with a height advantage is the throne, castle, fort whatever you call it.

players all spawn into the one map/arena, and then using the equipment/items on them they take on position of king.
They remain king for as long as they stay in the specified area/fort/castle if they die, another player in the area takes place as king or next person who goes there.

The winner is announced at the end of the game (When a timer runs out), the king currently in power or the previous king will be winner.

At the end the winner is given rewards and a *celebration* occurs (shortly).
(This is not yet implemented - as of beta1)

### Joining a game
To join a game/arena the arena must meet some criteria,
1. The arena cannot be full or not ready (you can check using `/koth list`)
2. The arena world must exist, cannot be deleted or re-named (if so you will have to delete and re-create it)
3. The arena must have spawn points.

If the arena meets all the above you can join using `/koth join <arena name>`

### Starting a game
The game will start the pregame - counter when the minimum amount of players has joined.

(In future you can force start)

### Leaving a game
As of Beta2 you can only leave by Leaving the server
or using `/koth leave`

### Winning a game
The game runs on a timer, during which anyone can move, attack and kill the king.
However when the timer runs out the last standing king, or the previous king will be crowned.
(And in future rewards and *other* things will be added)

(Notice, players are frozen during 'presentations of the king')

## Setting up
### Creating/Removing arena(s)
To create a new arena use the command `/koth new <arena name>` (No spaces are allowed in arena, for now)
To remove a arena use the command `/koth rem <arena name>` (The arena cannot be in use when deleting)

To check arena status type `/koth list` or `/koth info <arena name>`
### Setting positions/Values
 1. `/koth setpos1 <arena name>`
   (Make sure you are standing on one corner of the throne/hill.)
 2. `/koth setpos2 <arena name>`
   (Now stand on the opposite corner of the throne/hill.)
 3. `/koth setspawn <arena name>`
   (This command can be used as many times as you like, again be standing on the spawn location you want to set.)
 4. `/koth addreward <arena name> <command>`
   example: `/koth addreward arena1 give {PLAYER} 20 1` <- this would give the winner 1 web.
   DO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO `/`
### Editing Values
Currently (as of beta2) there is only one option:
1. Go into plugin_data->KOTH->arenas.yml
2. Find the arena you wish to edit (via name)
3. Find the value you wish to edit then change it and save the file.
4. Reload your server for it to take effect.
